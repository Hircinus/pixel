# Installation

To use Pixel in your project, simply link the CSS into your header and your JS into your footer:
```
...
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hircinus/pixel/master/src/pixel.min.css">
  ...
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hircinus/pixel/master/src/pixel.min.js"></script>
</body>
...
```

Alternatively, using those same links, you can download the files and host them locally.
